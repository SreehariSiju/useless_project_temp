# [NeveR Empty WasteBin] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Sreehari Siju]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Sreehari Siju] - [Sahrdaya College Of Engineering and Technology]

### Project Description
It is a wastebin that never likes to be empty. It must remain filled at all times.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
I feel that the wastebins are not used properly and people throw away the wastes elsewhere. So the existing waste bins arent being used to full potential.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
 So i made this wastebin that keeps making noise until it filled. It just cant stay empty.
